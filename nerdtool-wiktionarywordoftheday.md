Show wiktionary's word of the day somewhere on the desktop using Nerdtool (mac)
or conky (linux). At first glance there was no easy way to do this.

There seems to be an RSS feed of this, but was not quickly able to turn this
into a "distill the word and give me what I need" without writing a little
script.
