NFL has something like http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-nfl-predictions/.

This keeps track of Elo rating for teams and based on that simulates all the remaining games. This gives you percents for all the good stuff.

Do something like this for the belgian competition (and more?)

- clubelo.com already has Elo rating for clubs, could just use theirs.
- simulation is then a matter of having:
    - a list of games to be played
    - formula that estimates the result (and the score?)
