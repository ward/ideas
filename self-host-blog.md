Using blogger has its advantages, but hosting things myself could lead to a
more minimalistic site (currently a fresh reload of b.wardje.eu seems to have
taken *OVER 3MB*). Before doing so, do think about the advantages and
disadvantages this would entail.


Blogger notes:

* + No worries about heavy traffic
* + Commenting built in
* + No worries about my host going down
* - Frigging heavy
* - Social buttons
* - Switching would require ensuring every page still looks good
* - Self hosted could mean I might as well make the effort of porting some
  older tumblr posts
* + Likely easier high google search ranking?
* + Easy stats (could be handled by log analysers maybe)
* + Built in ads make for no need to think about that (but that only gave like
  30 euro since january 2012... not worth it)
