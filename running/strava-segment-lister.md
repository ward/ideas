Strava's segment explorer is completely useless. See if you can use their API
to get more of them and show them ourselves.  Also consider whether it has not
been done yet.

Alternatively, rather than having an explorer, create an overviewer. You
manually add the segments you care about and they are shown on the map (perhaps
with your time visible etc)
