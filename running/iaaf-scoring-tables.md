Check the IAAF scoring tables of athletics - outdoor as can be found on their
[technical documents](http://www.iaaf.org/about-iaaf/documents/technical)
section. This tries to give a score to your time on a certain distance. For us
the outdoor road running is relevant, but it also has mid distance track and
such.

This could be compared with the agegradeevaluation and the race results
distribution ideas.

Also useful would be a calculator/formula/datatables that are usable. Likely a
pain to create though.
