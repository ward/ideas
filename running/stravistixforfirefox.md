See how difficult it is to quickly convert this to a firefox addon.

WebExtensions were added in Firefox 48, should make this easy? Got this email:

> Dear Add-on SDK developer,
>
> WebExtensions are becoming the new standard for developing add-ons in
> Firefox, and the first official release reached Firefox 48 this week. The
> initial set of WebExtension APIs included in this release are:
>
> * Compatible with their counterparts in Chrome and Opera
> * Fully compliant with multiprocess Firefox (aka “Electrolysis”, or “e10s”)
> * Better sandboxed, so it’s easier to assess your add-on’s safety
>
>
> We encourage you to port your SDK add-on to WebExtensions, and we’ve created
> lots of resources to help you along.
>
> To see which migration path applies to you, please start with the
> [compatibility
> checker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Working_with_multiprocess_Firefox#Checking_whether_you%27re_affected).
> There is a new [API comparison
> chart](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Comparison_with_the_Add-on_SDK)
> that helps you find equivalent WebExtensions APIs for your add-on, as well as
> how-to guides and more at
> [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions).  If there
> are APIs you need that aren’t available yet, please provide feedback
> [here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/developer/communication#Managing_the_Impact).
