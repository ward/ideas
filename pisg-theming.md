Make own fork of Pisg with the theming disentangled from all the rest of it, as
far as possible.

Perhaps make it spit out the information in some standardised (text) format
that can then be used to fill in a webpage/theme of sorts.  This way, a theme
is the page/pages that you want with placeholders for the data that you would
like to show.  Using the theme is then a matter of filling things in using the
data gathered by Pisg.
