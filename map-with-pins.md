I like the Wikipedia maps with pins that are generated from a list of
coordinates and the choice of a map. E.g., pick Europe and enter coordinates
for Paris, Brussels, and London and you get a map image of Europe with markers
on those spots.

On Wikipedia this is done through the `Template:Location map`. The Lua code
this uses can be found in `Module:Location map`. Can I directly start using
this or will I need to actively convert things over?

Could this be fun to transfer to Rust?
